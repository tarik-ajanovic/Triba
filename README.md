# Triba - Second Web Dev University Project

## Description
This was the second website that I created during my time at the university. The task was to develop the frontend for a minigame called Triba.
The game consists of a grid in which 2 players have to draw triangles. These triangles cannot intersect so the winner is the player who places the last possible triangle.
The project was a part of my Web Development I course. 
The website was created using only vanilla HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript for the game logic.
